MMLV Editor is a program, level editor tool for Mega Man Maker to change any object's properties in a level file (.MMLV file format)

# Introduction

Nowadays, text-editing Mega Man Maker level is becoming more frequent and tedious process which led to time-consuming. There are users which do not wish to create level provided by the limitations of the gameplay itself.

This editor allows a level file (.mmlv) to be modified or a new level to be created. The tilesets, objects, ladders, spikes, backgrounds, active screens, and level properties can be edited visually which gives the user more control over the limitations.

# About

MMLV Editor is an external level editor tool for Mega Man Maker. It's main features are:  
- Manual tiling, allowing the user to have more level creation possibilities
- Object editing. For example, a 0.25-second laser beam which is not possible to make in the actual game.
- Manual disabling or enabling active screens. Useful for making empty rooms without having to put any object on the screen to activate.
- View your level visually.
- Save/Load level.
